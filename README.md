## To Do

###### List of features or bugs that need to be solved.



### Add batch processing in parallel tasks.

Run some batches in parallel instead of sequentially. Can use a lot of RAM (if run on CPU) but only uses roughly 10% of the CPU.



### Create better looking GUI.

Should reorganize the layout somewhat. Looks like a typical programmer GUI...
